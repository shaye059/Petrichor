A journal-keeping social media app aimed at encouraging users to reflect on the past. 

This app was created for a class project and therefore we were under a very restricted timeline while creating it.
For most of us it was our first android application and first time using a database. The whole development process 
was under 3 months and we were a team of 5. We plan on continuing work on the app even though the project has been 
submitted.

Version 1.0: This app is still in a beta version. Most parts work, however there are some crashes which are assumed
to be due to lag between the database and the app. If this is the case, adding some simple try catch statements with
a slight wait period should fix these issues. There are also some formatting issues with text on certain API's which
will also be fixed.

It should also be noted that in the current version, adding a friend works as following someone. The person who has
added the other can view their highlights, but the person who has been added cannot see who has added them unless
they get tagged in a highlight. This will be changed before the next version. Other future plans include:

-adding images to highlights
-allowing the user to choose the top highlights from the week, then at the end of the month choosing the top monthly 
 highlights from those weekly highlights, and again at the end of the year choosing the yearly highlights
-a page to view the top highlights
-reorganizing the Explore menu (group together time periods)
-general improvements with fullscreen and flow while moving through the app
